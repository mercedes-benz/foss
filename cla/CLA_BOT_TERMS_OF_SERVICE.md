      1.1.	Mercedes-Benz provides the respectively available functions of the CLA Bot free of charge.

**2.	Availability and Warranty**  
   2.1.	The Contributor has no claim to quality or performance features of the CLA Bot or to any support services from Mercedes-Benz for the use of the CLA Bot. Mercedes-Benz can modify, restrict or discontinue any functions, design, content and services of the CLA Bot at any time.

**1. Data Protection**    
We use an electronic assistant ("CLA Bot") to facilitate the conclusion of the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") with you as a Contributor to a Free and Open Source Project (each a "FOSS Project") managed by us.
The protection of your personal data is an important issue for us. In this data protection notice, we explain which personal data we collect when using the CLA Bot, what we do with it, for what purposes and on what legal basis this is done, and which rights and claims you are entitled to.

**2.	Collection and Processing of your Personal Data**    
The use of the CLA Bot requires the processing of your Github ID as well as of the result of running through the CLA Bot. We only store other personal data if you provide us with it and even in these cases only to the extent that we are permitted to do so under the applicable legal provisions.

**3.	Purposes of Processing**      
We use your personal data to facilitate the conclusion of the CLA as part of a FOSS project.

**4.	Transfer of Personal Data to Third Parties; Use of Service Providers**     
We use qualified service providers (IT service providers), some of which are also our subsidiaries, to operate, optimize and secure the data centers we use. We only pass on personal data to them insofar as this is necessary for the provision and use of the data centers and their functionalities as well as for the operation of the CLA-Bot. These service providers operate according to our instructions and are contractually obliged by us to comply with the data protection provisions in accordance with Article 28 GDPR. Within this scope, your personal may be disclosed to our IT service providers in third countries (e.g. India). Such disclosure is made solely for the purpose of providing the CLA Bot.
In third countries, there possibly is no consistently high level of data protection as in Europe. We therefore pay attention that data protection is also adequately warranted there. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses of the European Commission, certifications or approved codes of conduct. Please contact our data protection officer if you would like to receive more information on this.

**5.	Security**      
We use technical and organizational security measures to protect your data which we administer against manipulation, loss, destruction and against access by unauthorized persons. We continuously improve our security measures according to the technological developments.

**6.	Legal Basis for Processing**          
6.1.	The legal basis for processing of personal data for the purpose of initiation or performance of a contract with you is Art.6 (1) (b) GDPR.   
6.2.	Insofar as processing of your personal data is necessary for the fulfilment of our legal obligations (e.g. for the retention of data), we are authorized to do so pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR.  
6.3.	We also process personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Maintaining the functionality of our IT systems and facilitating the conclusion of a CLA are such legitimate interests. Within the respectively necessary balancing of interests we take into account in particular the type of personal data, the purpose of processing, the circumstances of the processing and your interest in the confidentiality of your personal data.

**7.	Cookies**        
When operating our CLA Bot, we only use the technically necessary cookies. These cookies are absolutely necessary to operate the electronic assistant, to use basic functions and to warrant the security of the CLA Bot. Such cookies neither collect information for marketing purposes nor do they store which websites you have visited. The legal basis for the cookies that are absolutely necessary to provide you with the service you have expressly requested is Section 25 (2) no. 2 of the German Telecommunications and Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG).

**8.	Deletion of your Personal Data**      
We retain your personal data for 30 years after the completion of a concluded CLA for preserving evidence. If no CLA is concluded, personal data will in principle be deleted no later than 30 days after its entry. Beyond the respective point in time, storage only takes place as far as this is required according to laws, regulations or other legal provisions, which we are subject to in the EU, or in accordance with legal provisions in third countries, if an appropriate level of data protection is provided there. As far as a deletion is not possible in an individual case, the relevant personal data will be marked with the aim of restricting its future processing. 

**9.	Rights of the Data Subject**     
9.1.	As a data subject, you have the right to information (Art. 15 GDPR), rectification (Art. 16 GDPR), erasure (Art. 17 GDPR), restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR) and data portability (Art. 20 GDPR).  
9.2.	Right to object:  
On grounds relating to your particular situation, you have the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data that is carried out based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (data processing based on a balance of interests). If you object, we will only process your personal data if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for doing so, which override your legitimate interests, rights and freedoms, or as far as the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. As far as we process your personal data for the purpose of conducting direct marketing based on a balance of interests, you also have the right to object thereto at any time without stating reasons.  
9.3.	We kindly ask you to send your requests or claims to the following contact address, if possible: foss@mercedes-benz.com.   
9.4.	If you are of the opinion that the processing of your personal data violates statutory requirements, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR).
