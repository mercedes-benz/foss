This par-ticularly includes the non-exclusive right of Mercedes-Benz to    
 (a)	use, test, run, host, access, grant access to, copy and otherwise reproduce the Contribution and any por-tions thereof, for any commercial or non-commercial purpose, in isolated form as well as combined with or integrated into products or components, without any restriction on territory, content or quantity (e.g. regard-ing user number), both on (also virtual) servers and on clients;   
 (b)	offer, demonstrate, sell, lease, otherwise distribute and make publicly or non-publicly available the Con-tribution or parts thereof to third parties, in any tangible or intangible form, for free or against fees, with or without restrictions, for any commercial or non-commercial purpose, under licensing terms and conditions at Mercedes-Benz choice, including proprietary license terms and free and open source license terms, including the FOSS License;  
 (c)	modify, adapt, configure, and create derivatives from the Contribution and any portion thereof, for any commercial or non-commercial purpose, particularly to decompile and disassemble the object code, modify, amend and replace (parts of) the source code, and to compile and assemble the modified or unmodified source code;

For the sake of clarity, any and all afore-mentioned notices of the Contribution to be used within the FOSS Project shall remain unaffected.

In the event of viola-tion of the above, Mercedes-Benz has the right to immediately withdraw from or terminate all legal transac-tions existing with the Contributor and the right to cancel all negotiations. The above notwithstanding, the Con-tributor is obliged to adhere to all laws and regulations applicable to both itself and the commercial relation-ship with Mercedes-Benz.   
  7.2 	In case of any separate agreement between the Contributor and Mercedes-Benz relating to the subject matter of the CLA, the terms of such separate agreement shall apply in addition and prevail, it being under-stood that Mercedes-Benz shall in any case at least obtain the rights in Contributions agreed in this CLA as a minimum standard. Such separate agreements shall not affect other participants of the FOSS Project.
